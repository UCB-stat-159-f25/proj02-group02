This project explores State of the Union speeches to see how presidential language has changed over time. We look at basic patterns in the speeches, process the text to understand common words and themes and use topic modeling tools to uncover the major ideas presidents focus on. The optional section lets us go further by examining how topics evolve, how similar different presidents’ speeches are, or how certain words rise and fall across history.
