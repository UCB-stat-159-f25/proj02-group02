3) how do I get the topic distirbution when using lda?

To get the topic distribution for documents in an LDA model, you typically use a specific method provided by the library you are using, such as gensim or scikit-learn.

Using Python Libraries
Gensim
In gensim, you use the get_document_topics method on your trained LdaModel instance. The input to this method should be the document in a bag-of-words (BoW) format.

# 'lda_model' is your trained LdaModel instance
# 'bow_corpus' is your corpus in bag-of-words format

# Get topic distributions for the entire training corpus
corpus_topic_distributions = [lda_model.get_document_topics(doc) for doc in bow_corpus]

# To get the full distribution (including topics with very low probability), 
# set the minimum_probability parameter to 0
full_topic_distribution = lda_model.get_document_topics(some_doc_bow, minimum_probability=0.0)

# The output for a single document is a list of tuples, e.g., [(topic_id, probability), ...]
# You can convert this to a full vector/list if needed, where indices correspond to topic IDs.

For more details, refer to the gensim documentation. 

Conceptual Explanation
The topic distribution is a fundamental output of an LDA model. It is a probabilistic vector for each document, indicating the proportion of each underlying topic present in that document. These probabilities sum to 1 for any given document. For example, a document might be 95% Topic 1 and 5% Topic 2. 

How do I use countvectorizer to remove stop words?

3) To remove stop words using CountVectorizer in scikit-learn, you can utilize the stop_words parameter during its initialization.

Method 1: Using a predefined list of stop words (e.g., 'english')

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

documents = [
    "This is a sample document about natural language processing.",
    "Another document for testing stop word removal.",
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
]

# Initialize CountVectorizer with the 'english' stop word list
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')

# Fit and transform the documents
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)

# Print the vocabulary to see which words were kept
print(vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())

Method 2: Providing a custom list of stop words

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

documents = [
    "This is a sample document about natural language processing.",
    "Another document for testing stop word removal.",
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
]

# Define your custom list of stop words
custom_stop_words = ["is", "a", "the", "this", "for", "about"]

# Initialize CountVectorizer with your custom stop word list
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words=custom_stop_words)

# Fit and transform the documents
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)

# Print the vocabulary to see which words were kept
print(vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())

In both methods, the CountVectorizer will automatically filter out the specified stop words before creating the vocabulary and counting word occurrences in your documents. The resulting X will be a sparse matrix where columns correspond to the non-stop words in your vocabulary.
