3) how do I get the topic distirbution when using lda?

To get the topic distribution for documents in an LDA model, you typically use a specific method provided by the library you are using, such as gensim or scikit-learn.

Using Python Libraries
Gensim
In gensim, you use the get_document_topics method on your trained LdaModel instance. The input to this method should be the document in a bag-of-words (BoW) format.

# 'lda_model' is your trained LdaModel instance
# 'bow_corpus' is your corpus in bag-of-words format

# Get topic distributions for the entire training corpus
corpus_topic_distributions = [lda_model.get_document_topics(doc) for doc in bow_corpus]

# To get the full distribution (including topics with very low probability), 
# set the minimum_probability parameter to 0
full_topic_distribution = lda_model.get_document_topics(some_doc_bow, minimum_probability=0.0)

# The output for a single document is a list of tuples, e.g., [(topic_id, probability), ...]
# You can convert this to a full vector/list if needed, where indices correspond to topic IDs.

For more details, refer to the gensim documentation. 

Conceptual Explanation
The topic distribution is a fundamental output of an LDA model. It is a probabilistic vector for each document, indicating the proportion of each underlying topic present in that document. These probabilities sum to 1 for any given document. For example, a document might be 95% Topic 1 and 5% Topic 2. 

How do I use countvectorizer to remove stop words?

3) To remove stop words using CountVectorizer in scikit-learn, you can utilize the stop_words parameter during its initialization.

Method 1: Using a predefined list of stop words (e.g., 'english')

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

documents = [
    "This is a sample document about natural language processing.",
    "Another document for testing stop word removal.",
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
]

# Initialize CountVectorizer with the 'english' stop word list
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')

# Fit and transform the documents
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)

# Print the vocabulary to see which words were kept
print(vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())

Method 2: Providing a custom list of stop words

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

documents = [
    "This is a sample document about natural language processing.",
    "Another document for testing stop word removal.",
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
]

# Define your custom list of stop words
custom_stop_words = ["is", "a", "the", "this", "for", "about"]

# Initialize CountVectorizer with your custom stop word list
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words=custom_stop_words)

# Fit and transform the documents
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)

# Print the vocabulary to see which words were kept
print(vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())

In both methods, the CountVectorizer will automatically filter out the specified stop words before creating the vocabulary and counting word occurrences in your documents. The resulting X will be a sparse matrix where columns correspond to the non-stop words in your vocabulary.





####
why does my myst deployed page look like this

Your page looks **exactly like a MyST site where the CSS, JS, and theme assets failed to load**.

When that happens, GitHub Pages (or any static host) will still show the HTML, but **everything looks huge, unstyled, stacked, and broken**, exactly like your screenshot.

This is almost always caused by one of the following:

---

# 1. **You deployed only `_build/html/index.html` but NOT the `_static/` folder**

MyST builds a whole directory:

```
_build/html/
    index.html
    _static/
    _images/
    _sources/
    searchindex.js
    ...
```

If you deploy only the HTML files without `_static/`, your site loses:

* CSS
* JavaScript
* icons
* theme files

→ Result: **unstyled page** (your screenshot).

Fix:

* Deploy **everything inside `_build/html`**, including hidden folders.

---

# 2. **Your deployment branch is wrong**

For GitHub Pages:

* If using `main` → put files in `docs/`
* If using `gh-pages` → push `_build/html` to that branch

You likely pushed only some files.

Correct workflow:

```
make html
cd _build/html
git init
git add .
git commit -m "deploy"
git push -f origin gh-pages
```

---

# 3. **Your `_config.yml` has a broken `html_baseurl`**

If you set something like:

```
html_baseurl: "/STAT159-Project2"
```

but your repo is actually named differently, your CSS paths break.

Your browser is probably trying to load:

```
https://username.github.io/_static/css/theme.css   (404)
```

instead of:

```
https://username.github.io/repo-name/_static/css/theme.css
```

Fix:

```
html_baseurl: https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/
```

or **remove `html_baseurl` entirely** (best for GitHub Pages).

---

# 4. **You moved files after building**

If you drag-and-drop files into GitHub → easy to accidentally break directory structure.

Make sure GitHub Pages sees:

```
/index.html
/_static/
```

on the same level.

---

# 5. **Your site is using absolute paths instead of relative paths**

If `_static/...` is referenced like:

```
href="/_static/theme.css"
```

Note the leading **/** — this breaks on GitHub Pages.

Correct MyST config:

```
html_use_modern_theme: true
sphinx:
  config:
    html_static_path: ['_static']
```

---

# What I need from you to confirm the cause

Paste **your project structure** on the deployed branch.
Run:

```
tree -L 2
```

or screenshot the folder layout of the deployed branch.

I can tell you the exact fix in one message once I see that.
